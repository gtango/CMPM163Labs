Description: This README is for Lab 5. It holds my videos of all three particle animations that we needed to make, as well as
a description of how I made the last video.

    How I Made This:
    
    I broke up the position of the particles into its x and y. For the x, I constrict its spread across the x axis. What I mean
    simply is that the particles move from left to right, without moving up and down. Then for the y, using the Math.cos()
    on the velocity of the particle I make them fall down, sort of like gravity although I do think they could have been better.
    I could have made them drop faster.
