Cube Description (Left to Right):

1) Light Multi-Colored Cube:
     This cube was made by importing a "mesh normal material" that I saw from the three.js examples in the lab. I had to use a hex code 0xddddd color which produces a mix of all colors with a green specular lighting and flat shading.
     
2) Yellow-Green-Red cube:
    This is the second shader made cube. Althought I interpolated again, I mixed with 4 different colors that is an attempt at the multicolored cube montana.

3) Greenish Hue Cube:
    This cube was one of our initial cubes. It was made from "mesh phong material" with the same grayish-multicolor, green specular light and shininess effect. 
    
4) Aquamarine-Red Cube:
    This cube was the first I made with a shader. This cube is interpolated using varying variables and mix() to mix the two colors, Tomato and Aquamarine, provided in the addCoolCube() function. 
    
5) Pink Line Cube:
    This is probably my favorite cube. I used one of the examples from the three.js examples. I used a "mesh basic material" with a pink hex color, and wireframe set to true to provide the line mesh.
